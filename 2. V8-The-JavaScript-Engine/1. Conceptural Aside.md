# Processors, Machine Code and C++

## Microprocessor - Machine that accepts instructions and provide output.

Different microprocessor takes different types of instructions (eg ARM, MIPS, etc..) and that is called **Machine code** (instructions that processor is able to understand)

We write languages that are easy for us to write and they can be converted to machine codes.

## The Hierarchy
Javascript - (High level language that is far from machine code - we do not have much control of memory management)
<br>|</br>
C/C++ - (close to machine code - we can manage memory)
<br>|</br>
Assembly Language
<br>|</br>
Machine Language

## Node is written in C++
### V8 (that converts javascript to machine code) is written in C++

## A JAVASCRIPT Engine
Converts js code into something the computer processor can understand and it should follow the ECMAScript standard on how the language should work and what features it should have.
