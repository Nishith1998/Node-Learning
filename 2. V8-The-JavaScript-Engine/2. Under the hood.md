# V8 JavaScript Engine

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine.

V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.

V8 implements ECMAScript standards.

V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application

## Adding feature to V8

The JavaScript functionalities implemented by v8 for browser is limited (can not do lower level operations such as files/folder access or databases connectivity)

I can add anything that C++ can do (such as lower level) to the v8 code to enable such operations.
